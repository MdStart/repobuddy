Multi-repository management tool for GIT

An easy alternative to git sub-modules, to configure and maintain multiple
Git repositories.

Features (planned)
------------------
-   Manage a project with multiple GIT repos.
-   XML based config file (can be versioned in GIT) with multiple
    possible configs, with each config representing a specific set of repos
    and the branches/tags which need to be cloned.
-   Sync up the latest config file, and update the local set of repos.
-   Switch between different configs seamlessly in the same local copy.

Inspired by Google's Android repo tool, but much simpler to configure,
customize and manage a project with multiple Git repositories.
